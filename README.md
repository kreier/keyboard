Experiences and measurements with different keyboards over the years

## Measurements

With the Covid-19 pandemic the interest in mechanical keyboards got a global spike, and the niche hobby became mainstream. Good products became affordable. I started a setup to measure the force-travel curve of the Apple butterfly keyboard in 2017, but never finished the project.

## History

###  1988 ZX81

My first computer, a [ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81), had a 40-key membrane keyboard. While usable, it was not very comfortable to use for longer time or write a program on in. The layout of the 13 (8x5) data lines was well documented. This inspired me for my first custom made keyboad:

### 1991 ZX81 Keyboard hack

I got a bare [C64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) keyboard, and rewired the PCB to match the 8x5 assignment of the 40 keys of the ZX81. 

### 1993 external housing for the Atari STFM 520 keyboard

My Atari was a AIO machine, while friends used PCs with external keyboards. Wouldn't it be nice if the Atari could be converted to this form factor? The PCB is larger than AT machines of this time, so a custum made shell from 3mm Aluminum was created:

### 2017 just 0.5 mm key travel with the Butterfly keyboard on a MacBook 12

The MacBook was a great engineering achievement with a full aluminum body, retina display and just 900 gramm weight. A lot had changed since my first laptop, a Thinkpad X32 from 2003. One of the many changes was the new keyboard, named "butterfly keyboard" by Apple. The keycaps were really large, the backlight just under the letters superb (almost no light bleeding to the edges) but the shallow key travel of only 0.5 millimeter was something most people never could get used to.

### 2025 hot swap mechanical

By now you can get so many mechanical keyboards, all kinds of RGB backlights and more than 1000 different switches to put in.
